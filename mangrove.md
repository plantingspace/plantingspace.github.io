## About
Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) for reviews. It provides an infrastructure that will allow anyone to capture and share their insights gained from experiences without the need for a central authority. It enables individuals and organisations to leverage this rich and valuable data freely.

The provided tools will allow reading, writing, and aggregating reviews, as well as integrating them into websites via an API.

## Main features
* **The dataset is a [Free Cultural Work](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition), licensed under [Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), thus not placing any restrictions on the type of use by anyone.** If you create content for all your fellow humans to benefit, why grant only one closed-source provider the rights to use it? You should be able to grant the whole world the rights to use it the way they want, as long as it is not misrepresented.
* **Reviewers' identities are created using public key cryptography, giving reviewers full control over their identity without administration by a central authority.** That means, you decide what to share with the public, and you are the only person holding the key to your identity. No need to trust a company storing your personal information and password.
* The aggregation of individual reviews into an overall rating can be done by anyone based on a large variety of algorithms; users can however also use **Mangrove's open aggregation algorithm** freely.
* Besides a rating and a text, **reviewers can add media files** such as photos or audio files to enrich their reviews.

* **To ensure a high reliability** of the reviews:
    * Businesses can invite their customers to leave reviews in the Mangrove database via an email link, allowing to mark those reviews as 'verified purchases'.
    * Reviewers can upload sanitized bills or receipts to improve their credibility
    * Reviews can receive comments, e.g., from a business replying to their customer's feedback, or ratings to indicate agreement or disagreement with the review.
    * The overall rating takes into account each reviewer's reliability score that is assigned based on a number of factors, such as previous reviews, or the ratings of those reviews by other reviewers.

Why should people care about reviews?
</summary>
  
  We all benefit from leveraging the experiences of others for our own decision-making. We feel an intrinsic need to share with others information about things we used and experienced, and to make use of such information ourselves before we invest resources. 

In the past we relied mostly on our personal network to get recommendations or reviews for anything from restaurants, movies, travel destinations, to appliances or services. 

With the advent of the internet, it became possible to leverage a much larger group of people for this purpose. Forums and online communities sprung up where people from all over the world could share their opinions and experiences with millions of Internet users, influencing each others' decisions through online word-of-mouth.

The world is growing more complex, and so are the choices that we have to make each day. The number of services, products, media outlets, books, travel destinations, websites, apps, is growing, and it takes more effort to navigate the global range of offerings. We increasingly look up information online when we want to buy something or go somewhere, and we actively search for other people's opinions in order to form our own (research studies performed by [IMC](https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/) or  [BrightLocal](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/#methodology) have quantified this trend). 

In addition, the opinions of customers in the form of online reviews have become crucial for businesses. Reviews can impact businesses' reputation, their ranking in search results, and even their profitability, as consumers are willing to pay more for products for which reviews are available.

Companies such as Google, Yelp, FourSquare, TrustPilot, Facebook, TripAdvisor, have recognised this trend already years ago, and offered platforms with listings of businesses on which users could leave reviews as well as leverage other people's reviews for free. By now, these services boast hundreds of millions of consumer reviews on their websites and applications. The crowd-sourced data has become a well-guarded gold mine for these companies, based on which they predominately generate revenues from advertising, redirections, as well as from selling the personal data of their platform users.

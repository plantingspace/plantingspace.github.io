# What is Mangrove
Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) for reviews. It provides an infrastructure that will allow anyone to capture and share their insights gained from experiences without the need for a central authority. It enables individuals and organisations to leverage this rich and valuable data freely.

The provided tools will allow reading, writing, and aggregating reviews, as well as integrating them into websites via an API.

# Main features
* **The dataset is a [Free Cultural Work](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition), licensed under [Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), thus not placing any restrictions on the type of use by anyone.** If you create content for all your fellow humans to benefit, why grant only one closed-source provider the rights to use it? You should be able to grant the whole world the rights to use it the way they want, as long as it is not misrepresented.
* **Reviewers' identities are created using public key cryptography, giving reviewers full control over their identity without administration by a central authority.** That means, you decide what to share with the public, and you are the only person holding the key to your identity. No need to trust a company storing your personal information and password.
* The aggregation of individual reviews into an overall rating can be done by anyone based on a large variety of algorithms; users can however also use **Mangrove's open aggregation algorithm** freely.
* Besides a rating and a text, **reviewers can add media files** such as photos or audio files to enrich their reviews.

* **To ensure a high reliability** of the reviews:
    * Businesses can invite their customers to leave reviews in the Mangrove database via an email link, allowing to mark those reviews as 'verified purchases'.
    * Reviewers can upload sanitized bills or receipts to improve their credibility
    * Reviews can receive comments, e.g., from a business replying to their customer's feedback, or ratings to indicate agreement or disagreement with the review.
    * The overall rating takes into account each reviewer's reliability score that is assigned based on a number of factors, such as previous reviews, or the ratings of those reviews by other reviewers.

# About

We build tools that aim to evolve some of the fundamental patterns of how humans interact, discover, and create.

We are just at the beginning of this journey. If you would like to find out more about the projects and/or get involved, please reach out: tellmemore@planting.space 

The content provided here is work in progress, we will be adding information as we proceed, and welcome feedback and input. 

# Projects

### Mangrove

Mangrove is an initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share valuable insights with each other.

It aims to offer an alternative to the proprietary and exploitative information silos of Google, Amazon, and others.

For this purpose, Mangrove will provide an infrastructure that will allow anyone to capture reviews and assessments in an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). As such, it will be freely available to all, including people who want to improve their decision-making, application builders, and researchers.

Mangrove should allow anyone to freely share their assessments of, and experiences with services, products, websites, places, and more - for the benefit of all.

### Taiga

A tool for gathering knowledge and gaining insights. By finding the universal language to capture our current understanding of the world, Taiga aims to make it easier to find the frontiers of what is known and help us push beyond that. Taiga draws heavily on domains of category theory and probabilistic modeling.

### Broadleaf

Broadleaf is an open set of values and tools. It enables the coordination of individual contributors or whole groups of people to achieve a goal, such as delivering a project, a portfolio of many projects, or a long-term mission. 

It works for whole companies, project teams within companies, open source projects, or initiatives of any kind. 

Its first element, the values, is crucial because values guide the mindset behind how work gets done, and help attract people that share the same values. Its second element, the tools, enable the realization of the values. Tools consist of two types: on one hand Broadleaf provides concrete frameworks for structuring what has to get done, organising resources, scaling, getting funding in alignment with the values, etc. On the other hand Broadleaf leverages technology, i.e., application software, to make applying the frameworks as smooth and simple as possible.

The graph below explains how the different elements are connected. The text icons next to the nodes provide more context.

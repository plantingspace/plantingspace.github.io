# Projects

### Taiga

Taiga is a research project, aiming to create a tool for gathering knowledge and gaining insights. By finding the universal language to capture our current understanding of the world, Taiga aims to make it easier to find the frontiers of what is known, and help us push beyond that. Taiga draws heavily on domains of category theory and probabilistic modeling.

### Mangrove

Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share valuable insights with each other without a central authority.

It aims to offer an open and decentralized alternative to the proprietary information silos of Google, Amazon, and others.

For this purpose, Mangrove will provide an infrastructure that will allow anyone to capture personal opinions, assessments, experiences in the form of reviews in an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). As such, it will be freely available to all, from individuals searching for reviews of products, websites, services, places, and more, to application builders, or researchers.

### Broadleaf

Broadleaf is an organisational concept and a concrete framework for organizing work. It represents an alternative to the traditional setup characterized by management layers, org charts with job descriptions, and formal employment. 

All PlantingSpace projects are organized following an open set of Broadleaf principles and tools. 

Broadleaf organisations will be attractive for entrepreneurial people who value autonomy, who are purpose-driven, and who want to achieve goals efficiently in a team.

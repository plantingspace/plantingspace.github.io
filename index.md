## About

We build tools that aim to evolve some of the fundamental patterns of how humans interact, discover, and create.

We are just at the beginning of this journey. If you would like to find out more about the projects and/or get involved, please reach out: tellmemore@planting.space 

The content provided here is work in progress, we will be adding information as we proceed, and welcome feedback and input. 

## Projects

### Mangrove

* A set of tools and an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) that allow individuals to capture and share their assessments and reviews of services or tools they used. 
* We all benefit from leveraging the experiences of others for our own decision-making. We feel an intrinsic need to share with others information about things we used and experienced, and to make use of such information ourselves before we invest resources. Reviews are therefore an important common good that should be openly sharable and available to all.
* Services like Google Reviews, Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc., brought the possibility to share on a global scale. While this has been a step in the right direction, the current model is not leading us towards the ideal of sharing insights freely. We see 3 major issues that arise from the fact that this data currently resides within a number of proprietary silos:
  * partitioning --> people have to look in several places for reviews; they have to decide each time on which platform to leave a review; number of reviewers and rating scores are different on each platform
  * proprietary --> lack of control; possibility of censorship; possibility that the whole platform gets closed down
  * barrier for innovation --> doesn't allow creators to create new and useful tools; high barriers for leveraging this rich information

Following the Broadleaf organisation structure (more below), we break down what needs to get done in order to achieve the goal of this project, and we share it openly: check out the overview below.

We see this open data set as a common good, and we invite everyone to contribute to its realisation. Please write us at joinin@planting.space if you would like to contribute and we will add you to the project.

### Taiga

A tool for gathering knowledge and gaining insights. By finding the universal language to capture our current understanding of the world, Taiga aims to make it easier to find the frontiers of what is known and help us push beyond that. Taiga draws heavily on domains of category theory and probabilistic modeling.

### Broadleaf

Broadleaf is an open set of values and tools. It enables the coordination of individual contributors or whole groups of people to achieve a goal, such as delivering a project, a portfolio of many projects, or a long-term mission. 

It works for whole companies, project teams within companies, open source projects, or initiatives of any kind. 

Its first element, the values, is crucial because values guide the mindset behind how work gets done, and help attract people that share the same values. Its second element, the tools, enable the realization of the values. Tools consist of two types: on one hand Broadleaf provides concrete frameworks for structuring what has to get done, organising resources, scaling, getting funding in alignment with the values, etc. On the other hand Broadleaf leverages technology, i.e., application software, to make applying the frameworks as smooth and simple as possible.

The graph below explains how the different elements are connected. The text icons next to the nodes provide more context.

# About

We build tools that aim to evolve some of the fundamental patterns of how humans interact, discover, and create.

If you would like to find out more about our projects, to get involved, or to provide feedback, please reach out: tellmemore@planting.space  

# Projects

### Taiga

Taiga is a research project, aiming to create a tool for gathering knowledge and gaining insights. By finding the universal language to capture our current understanding of the world, Taiga aims to make it easier to find the frontiers of what is known, and help us push beyond that. Taiga draws heavily on domains of category theory and probabilistic modeling.

### Mangrove

Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share valuable insights with each other.

It aims to offer an open and decentralized alternative to the proprietary information silos of Google, Amazon, and others.

For this purpose, Mangrove will provide an infrastructure that will allow anyone to capture personal opinions, assessments, experiences in the form of reviews in an [open data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). As such, it will be freely available to all, from individuals searching for reviews of products, websites, services, places, and more, to application builders, or researchers.

### Broadleaf

Broadleaf is an organisational concept and a concrete framework for organizing work. It represents an alternative to the traditional setup characterized by org charts, hierarchies, and formal employment. 

All PlantingSpace projects are organized following an open set of Broadleaf principles and tools. 

Broadleaf organisations will be attractive for people who value autonomy and have an entrepreneurial spirit, who are purpose-driven and want to know what overarching goals they are contributing to, who want to get things done efficiently and embrace accountability, and who have a desire for constant learning and growth.

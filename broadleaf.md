# Overview

Broadleaf is an organisational concept and a concrete framework for organizing work. It consists of an open set of values and tools, and enables the coordination of individual contributors or whole groups of people to achieve a goal, such as delivering a project, or a long-term mission. 

# Common values of Broadleaf organisations

While each project that makes use of Broadleaf has its own goal and values, there are some common values that drive how work is organised in general.

* **The goal is more important than the entity that delivers it**
    * Every contributor, task, or tool in the organisation are aligned towards one clearly articulated ultimate goal
    * Contributors don't sign up for an entity; they sign up for a concrete goal: everyone has at all times clarity on what they are ultimately helping to achieve.
    * The goal can live beyond the entity, and leverage any entities it needs. Purpose-driven open contribution and decentralisation reduce zero-sum competition.
    
* **The individual contribution matters, not the position**
    * The notion of positions to determine a person's place in the organisation is made obsolete: people can move freely between teams they work with by choosing the tasks they want to commit to.
    * The notion of positions to determine a person's career in the organisation is made obsolete: broadening skill sets and performance improvements are reflected in a person's "reliability score", determined by successful accomplishment of tasks; the higher the reliability score, the higher-impact, higher-complexity tasks a person can take on.
    * Rigid role descriptions are replaced by well-defined, specific tasks that are linked to the ultimate goal; people apply for tasks freely and make a claim for budget needs and concrete deliverables they can commit to; candidates get chosen according to a transparent selection process. 
    * People are not paid for filling positions but for individual tasks they deliver on; this gives a person flexibility to take on tasks that fit the current skill level and personal circumstances, and reduces unhealthy pressure.

* **Clarity has to be ensured at all times**
    * A task has to be justified in terms of its contribution to the ultimate goal. This allows everyone in the organisation to develop their judgment whether the most important issues are well-covered, or whether new tasks are needed.
    * The problem that a task is supposed to solve has to be well defined, with constraints and its solution space outlined.
    * What constitutes success for a task has to be articulated so that delivery and reliability score can be determined without conflicts.


# Tools

Tools consist of two types: on one hand Broadleaf provides **concrete frameworks for structuring what has to get done**, organising resources, scaling, getting funding in alignment with the values, etc. On the other hand Broadleaf leverages technology, i.e., **application software**, to make applying the frameworks as smooth and simple as possible.
